        "\"Create a 60-second cinematic video of a powerful ocean storm. Towering waves rise and crash violently against jagged, dark rocky cliffs, sending sprays of white foam into the air. The sky is a chaotic mix of swirling dark gray clouds, periodically illuminated by blinding flashes of lightning that streak across the horizon. Thunder rumbles deeply, shaking the atmosphere. In the foreground, sea birds struggle to stay aloft, their silhouettes faintly visible against the stormy sky. The camera pans from the turbulent water to the cliffs, showing streams of rainwater cascading down the rocks. As the lightning flashes, it briefly reveals a ship in the distance, battling the waves with its sails torn and mast creaking under the wind’s force. The scene concludes with a dramatic close-up of a wave breaking in slow motion, the spray glistening in the fleeting light of another lightning strike.\"\n"
