# Python_APIs
Parameters of API

##Messages:
The messages parameter provides the context and structure for the conversation. It is a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary has two keys: role (e.g., system, user, or assistant) and content (the text for that role). This helps the API understand the dialogue history and generate relevant responses.

Example:
messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Tell me a joke."}
]

##Model:
The model parameter specifies the version of model to be used, such as gpt-3.5-turbo or gpt-4. Each model has different capabilities, costs, and performance levels, allowing users to choose the one that best fits their needs. 

Example:
model = "gpt-4"

##Max Completion Tokens:
The max_tokens parameter defines the maximum length of the generated response in tokens. This limits the output length and helps manage costs and response times.

Example:
max_tokens = 150
This limits the API response to a maximum of 150 tokens.

##n:
The n parameter specifies how many response variations the API should generate for a single prompt. It allows users to explore multiple possible answers and choose the one that best fits their requirements.

Example:
n = 3
This generates three different completions for the input.

##Stream:
The stream parameter, when set to true, enables the API to return responses incrementally as they are generated, instead of waiting for the full completion. This is useful for applications requiring real-time updates, such as chatbots or live transcription tools.

Example:
stream = True
This streams the response incrementally instead of waiting for the full response.

##Temperature:
The temperature parameter controls the randomness of the response. Higher values (e.g., 0.8) encourage creativity and diverse outputs, while lower values (e.g., 0.2) make the response more focused and deterministic.

Example:
temperature = 0.6
This balances creativity and precision in the response.

##Top_p:
The top_p parameter adjusts the diversity of the output by considering the top probability tokens until their cumulative probability reaches p. It provides an alternative to temperature for controlling randomness.

Example:
top_p = 0.85
This ensures the response includes only the most likely tokens that make up 85% of the probability mass.

##Tools:
The tools parameter allows the integration of external tools or plugins, such as code execution or web browsing, to extend the API's functionality. This enables the model to perform tasks beyond text generation.

Example:
tools = ["code_execution"]
This allows the assistant to execute code during the session.
