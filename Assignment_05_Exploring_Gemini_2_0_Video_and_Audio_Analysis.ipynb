She emphasizes the importance of keeping these introductions strictly professional, rather than revealing personal life details. The interviewer is focused on assessing a candidate's suitability for the job and company, along with their experience, confidence, communication, and social skills.\n\n**0:30 - 1:00**\nShe continues discussing the reason behind why a self-introduction is necessary even when the interviewer has a resume, explaining that the interviewer wants to see how well the candidate can present themselves verbally. She then points to another video on the screen with resume tips. The interviewer also asks to be introduced to the candidate.\n\n**1:00 - 1:30**\nThe presenter introduces the outline for an interview self introduction. She notes to start by giving a greeting and then thanking the interviewer for the opportunity. Next, she says to introduce yourself by saying your name and then mentioning where you are residing.\n\n**1:30 - 2:00**\nShe continues to explain the self introduction outline, saying that after stating your name and location, a fresher candidate should talk about their educational background and mention their degree and institution. She also mentions to highlight relevant projects you have worked on in education.\n\n**2:00 - 2:30**\nShe introduces the self-introduction outline for experienced professionals and says to start by talking about your current or latest job role and mention the company name, your designation, your tenure, and the responsibilities you were accountable for. Lastly, she mentions highlighting any important accomplishments you have not stated in your resume. She emphasizes the importance of sounding enthusiastic while introducing yourself.\n\nHopefully this helps! Let me know if you have any other requests!"
